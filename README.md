### Civic Engagement Platform and Alerts (CEPA)
* Overall architecture of this system will espouse this trifecta philosophy: 
	* **The CEPA Client** for the user frontend and community/administrative tools.
	* **The CEPA Knowledgebase** with robust APIs to serve as the knowledge base.
	* **The CEPA Network**, in order to decentralize and democratize the infrastructure.
- An app that helps its users stay in touch with who's representing them in all levels of government, when elections are, what's being voted on, and who the candidates are.
- Start with a main app that's meant to be a baseline of information (i.e. all versions of this app must show at least the baseline information).
- Develop community forums which are self-hosted and moderated by neighborhood.
- Allow states and cites to have their own "skin" of this app with the ability to gamify it in their own way.
